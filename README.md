# Atmospheric Model 3 (AM3)
AM3 (Donner et al., 2011), the atmospheric component of the GFDL coupled model CM3, was designed with an awareness of key emerging issues in climate science, including aerosol-cloud interactions in climate and climate change, chemistry-climate feedbacks, land and ocean carbon cycles and their interactions with climate change, and decadal prediction.
More information is available on the [GFDL AM3](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/atmospheric-model/) page.


The data exploration of the 3-D (latitude, longitude, altitude) cloud ice distributions simulated by AM3 and AM4 climate models are provided to serve as the data basis, developed from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory for more accurate understanding of the cloud ice distribution patterns for the prediction of the climate change as it drastically impacts the Earthâ€™s radiate balance.
